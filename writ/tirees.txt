The 'Tirees: Alpine Village

They've been on the road, living life, for a while
now. Their home: their motorhome. Rolling
along, past the golden pastures. Driving into the
rising sun; making what they can of it before it sets.
The glare visors are down on the driver and pas-
senger sides.
"What's a seven letter word for something hard
to understand?" asks Angela.
"It's a mystery," Burt replies, shifting gears, "...
beats me".
"Oh well," Angela says, putting her paperback
Cryptic Crosswords down on her lap, readjusting
her thick glasses, and opening out the map.
"Where to today, darl'?" Bob asks.
"Well," Angela says, "it would be nice to make it
through to St Radamp."
"Yep, yep, that's alirght, ol' Carol here can get
us there, no prob'," Burt says, tapping his knuckle
on the dash, "hmm... though we'll need to stop for
more gas."
So they hum along; chewing up the road and
#

watching the landscape change.

Eventually, an Amalgamated Petrolium sign
rises up from out of the road ahead.
"Oh that's good," Angela says.
"I'm not so sure," says Burt, "did you see the
sign: $2.84 a stuck."
Burt flicks on the indicator and pulls on into
the empty forecourt. The filling station attendant
comes out from the store.
"Can I fill this beauty up?" she asks.
"Alright," grumbles Burt, popping the fuel door
latch and climbing down gingerly from the driver's
seat.
"Gosh, aren't you a pretty wee one," says An-
gela, from out the window, "what's your name?
Sorry, I can't read your name tag."
"My name's Laura, nice to meet y'all. Y'all
weren't plannin' on headed through to St Radamp
by any chance were ya?" Laura asks, using the
gas pump nozzle to point down the road.
"Well, we were, are you going to tell us not to?"
asks Angela.
"It's just the word from the Transportation Au-

thority is that there's work bein' done on H64,"
Laura says, "They're askin' folks to detour through
Mount Crancham."
"Oh pickles and pumpkins!" Angela says.
"Nah, it ain't too bad, it's quite pretty up there
really," Laura says, "pity it ain't wintertime, why it's
darn near a wonderland then, what with the snow
they can get up ther'."
"Well, I'm looking at the map hon, and it will
probably put us out a day," Angela calls out.
"Doesn't sound like we have much choice in it,"
Burt shouts back, scratching his bald spot.
"Yep, you'll want to be careful on the RD58
though," laughs Laura, hanging the nozzle up on
the pump, "she's as windy as a pocketwatch, that
one."
"Alight," Burt says, walking with the lady to-
ward the store, "what do we owe you for gas in the
end?"
"Oh, Burt, could you get us some more Barley
Caramels for the trip too?" Angela calls out.

Angela stares out the side window, her mind
lost in the forest of trees. An orange road sign

flashes by, indicating the detour ahead.
"Well, this looks like it's it," Angela says.
"Uh huh," says Burt, flicking on the blinker and
moving into the flush median for the turn off.
The road starts to climb up and up, hugging the
pine topped cliffs.
"The lady at the station wasn't joking," Burt
says, dropping down a gear, "These corners are
pretty darn tight."
"Well, I'll be," Angela says, "look at that bridge
there'.
"Wow, now, that sure is something," Burt says,
gripping the wheel, "That's quite a gorge."
Biting the corner of his lip, Burt feels a weight
in the bottom of his stomach. Carol grips onto the
suspended road, bleating in the low gear, and
slowly makes her way across. Angela gets out
her camera, and snaps a couple of pictures of the
drop below.
"What fun!" Angela says, fiddling with the
stereo, "let's have some music."

I love you through and through
Yo-de-lay-hee-hoo...
#
Still tapping his thumb on the steering wheel,
Burt realizes he hadn't been paying as much at-
tention to the road as he ought've. He shakes his
head to bring his focus back. Burt looks in the
rearview and decides to pull over onto the shoul-
der of the coming hairpin for a moment (a move
greeted with hooting applause from the passing
traffic). The road sign ahead reads: Mount Cran-
cham, 20 kilocubits.
"Not long to go now," Angela says, stirring for
a moment, smiling at Burt, then settling back in to
watching the scenery pass by her side window.
#

#
They're up into the fog now. The mist is seep-
ing through the pines and out onto the road.
"Keep your eyes peeled for deer darl'," Burt
says, turning the foglights on.

The lights stretch on out in long thin cones
through the hanging grayness of tiny droplets in
the air.
"Well, now, here we go," Angela says, reading
the sign: "Welcome to Mount Crancham."
"I suppose we'd be able to see mountains if it
weren't for the fog," says Burt.
"Indeed," chuckles Angela, "well, let's find an
Info Hut, it would be nice to know where we can
park up and I'd like to know if there is anything we
can see while we're here."
Apex frame houses start to emerge out the
mist, followed by the lacquer stained wooden fas-
cades of the commercial buildings comprising the
Mount Crancham central business district.
"Hmm... river rafting..." mutters Angela, "... I
don't know. Burt, is there anything you want to do
here?"
"You know what, I wouldn't mind going to the -,"
Burt starts.
"Oh, quick! It's the Info Hut," Angela says, "turn
in here."
The bell rings as Angela bursts in through the
saloon-style doors, with Burt in tow. Mounted
game and maps cover the walls of a dim room
filled with carousel literature racks. Angela stops,
#

spotting an empty service desk.
"Oh hullo," calls the clerk, from by the pot belly
stove in the corner, "now ain't you two just the
cutest in those matching tracksuits of yours. My
name's Mr Eric Simonson, pleased to meet you."
"Thank you," Angela says, as Burt starts flick-
ing through some of the shelves, "I'm Angela and
this is Burt, we just got in; and seeing as we're in,
I'm thinking we might as well stay a tick."
"Oh sure," says Mr Eric Simonson, stroking his
moustache and peeking out the window, "... and
that's y'all in the mustard RV, huh? Well, y'all'll be
after Mountain Pass Camping Ground just up the
road, they have powered sites and just loads of
ammenities."
"Good good," says Burt, picking out a fishing
pamphlet, "hey, don't suppose you can give away
any good spots on the, what's this, the... Nant-
garth river?
"Oh sir," Mr Eric Simonson says, loosening his
tie a little, "umm... it ain't really a good time to be
taking a trip through to the Nantgarth. The forest...
And, besides, why bother catching a meal when
there's such fine eating to be had at Shirley-Sue's
Diner."
"You don't say?" says Angela, "do they have

carrot flamb√≥nge?"
"Oh, sure they do," says Mr Eric Simonson, re-
gaining his palor, "the best in the district. Is there
anything else I can do you for you fine folks?"
"Maybe... " says Burt, holding the pamplets,
"you mind if I take these?"
"Oh sure, you go right on ahead," Mr Eric Si-
monson says, wiping his brow and leading Angela
and Burt to the door, "oh, and it's Jolene Turner
who runs the Mountain Pass Camping Ground,
she'll treat you right. Thanks for coming through,
hope you enjoy your stay in Mount Crancham."

That evening, the grey fog gave way to a night
sky embroidered, as if by needlepoint, with shiny
silver stars. Above the mountain's peak, a curdled
milk moon spilled it's light over the township below.
Those with keen hearing, and a youthful ability to
stay awake past sun down, might've even heard
the howls and hooting of the night's creatures
at play. But so it was that, no sooner had they
checked in at the Mountain Pass Camping Ground,
Angela and Burt had fallen fast asleep. And so
that night too, joined all the rest, in the past.

This morning, Burt could hear a blackbird
chirping outside. Stirring, he feels the wet of a
slaver covered pillow against his face. Pulling the
crust off his eyes, he sees the golden light of day
streaming into the motorhome.
"Good morning, hon," says Angela, "now, I was
talking with Jolene Turner, you know, the lady in
charge, she's such a hoot; she was saying we're
welcome to take a couple of her spare sets of golf
clubs and head over to the course today. She even
has a cart, and trundlers too, if we want. Well...
wouldn't that be fun!?"
"Sure, hon," Burt says, squishing his stubbled
face.
"Well?" asks Angela, "oh, Burt; wake up, sleepy
head. There's tea in the pot, and a boiled egg for
you in the saucepan. Could you put some more
toast down? Thanks, hon'."
Burt slips his slippers on and shuffles over to
the kitchenette, stopping to give Angela a kiss on
the cheek.
"Oh, I know that one Angela: 'Beware'," Burt
says, "number 6, down; 'watch out for danger'; a
six letter word starting with 'B' and ending with 'E'."
"Well, there you go," Angela says, adjusting her
glasses, "... I mustn't have been thinking. Thanks

hon'."
Squeeking into the naugahyde seating of the
dinette, opposite Angela, Burt almost has a bite in
his mouth when they hear a knock at the door.
"Yoo-hoo," the voice says.
"Hi there, come on in," Angela says, frowning
suddenly, "you'll just have to excuse Burt here, in
his underpants."
"It's my damn place, I don't need pants on if I
don't want to," Burt says through a mouthful of his
breakfast.
"Sorry to intrude. My name is James, I just
wanted to say 'hi'; it looks as though we're neigh-
bours." says James, "Jolene Turner mentioned
that you folks had been on your way to St Radamp
too."
"Well, 'hello' to you, James, that's sweet of
you," says Angela, "yes, we were on our way to
St Radamp, but had to make the detour. Would
you like a cup of tea?"
"That would be lovely," James says, squeez-
ing in next to Burt and offering his hand to shake,
"James, pleasure."
"Burt," Burt says, wiping his hand on his leg,
"likewise."
"Wow what a marvelous tea cosy," James

says, as Angela fills the porcelin with amber, "how
lovely."
"So James," Angela says, "where have you
come from?"
"The blue and yellow tent just there, but that's
not what you mean," James says, slapping the ta-
ble like a drum kit, "The kids and I were heading
up from Grimsby; it's my week with them, you see.
What about you folks?"
"Well, we have a little place in Illsbury. But,
we've been touring about the place," says Angela,
"it's something Burt and I always wanted to do and
retirement is our chance to do it."
"Good for you," says James, "that's just lovely."
"Hey, any word on what's caused the detour,
anyway?" asks Burt, coughing to clear his throat.
"It's a bit strange," says James, leaning in, "I heard
it was flooding on the H64. But it hasn't been rain-
ing very much."
"We did have a little bit of drizzle coming over
from Vinmire," says Angela thoughtfully, "but, we're
in no rush. Do you need to be in St Radamp by a
specific day?"
"No, not really, just trying to get in some qual-
ity time," says James, "they grow up so fast, don't
they."

"They sure do," smiles Angela.
"Hey, but that's mine!" cries a girl's voice from
outside.
"Oh dear, I can't even leave them alone for a
minute without them squabbling," says James,
"hey look, thank you for the cup of tea, that was
really lovely. I'll hope to see you around."
"Well, thank you, James," Angela says.
"You folks have a good one now," says James,
leaving, "now - what have I told you two about get-
ting along!"
"He was nice," Angela says, taking the cups
away.
"Sure," Burt says, "though I like to have a quiet
cup of tea in the morning."
"Oh shush you," says Angela, "go and get
dressed; I would have you take us golfing".
