Dear Rose,
#
Happy birthday to you!
#
Hopefully you have a most totally super-
wonderful day, filled with lots of peace and 
joy. You deserve all the good things :).
#
You are the best because you are charming and 
patient, just like your names say, and you have 
such a nice calm style. Also you're fun and 
caring and I think that you are very beautiful 
too.
#
It would be nice to write you a story thing for 
your birthday. Eek, it might be a bit rushed 
though. Let's see...it could be about a pretty 
lady. Maybe like an adventure story, but also 
very scary because of ghosts. Hopefully it will 
come together okay.
#
Will look forward to seeing you again.
#
Love,
Trent
