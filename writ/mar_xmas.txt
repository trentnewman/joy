Dear Marilyn,
I wanted take this moment to express my gratitude to you. Thank you 
for the support, opportunities and guidance that you have given me. 
You are a wonderful person and it has been a privilege to learn from 
you.
Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! I hope that the holiday 
season will bring peace and joy to you and your family.
Best wishes,
Trent
