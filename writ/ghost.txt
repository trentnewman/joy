An untitled ghost story
#
I...
#
The pretty lady was in her room one
night when, with her most perfectly cute
ears, she heard a curious sound. She
placed the cloth-bound Shakespeare
which had become a bit tiresome any-
way onto the side table and proceeded
prettily over to the window. Adjusting out
the brass casement stay let in a midnight
breeze upon the coat-tails of which rode
in a very odd spectre indeed.
#
The ghost looked about the room,
spotted the pretty lady and spoke, "how
goes it, you?"
"My, where are your manners?" The
pretty lady replied, "I was not expecting a
guest at this hour, let alone one of a see-
through variety!"

"Quite," the ghost said, taking up resi-
dence in the berg√®re armchair and flicking
through the pretty lady's book, "my apolo-
gies."
#
"Well, to what do I owe the inconve-
nience of this unexpected, and I might
add, rather ill-mannered, company?" The
pretty lady asked, unconsciously tapping
her exquisite bare foot on the rug.
"It is somewhat of a long story," the
ghost replied, playing with one of the but-
tons on his military coatee, "but, are you
busy? It so happens that the situation as it
stands presently could warrant a contribu-
tion of your assistance."
"The cheek of you, you... you phantom,
you! It is past my bed time as it is," the
pretty lady said.
"Completely," shrugged the ghost, "...
though if you should come, I might be in-
clined to share with you a most humorous

joke."
"My," said the pretty lady, rubbing the
lace neck of her nightgown between her
thumb and index finger as she pondered,
"is that so?"

The pretty lady and the ghost flew over
cobbled stones in the dead of night.
"This way," the ghost said, leading her
down a dark passageway.
The ghost then conjured a little glow-
ing star that hovered above them and il-
luminated the ornate facade of a shoppe
with a sign that read, "Spice Merchant".
"My," the pretty lady said, "to what curi-
ous end have you led me here?"
"Salt", said the ghost solemnly, as his
phantasmic hand unlocked the door, "let
us peruse what stock may be to our avail."
#
"What a splendid concoction of aro-
mas," the pretty lady said as she marveled
at a near infinite array of coloured contain-
ers.
"Aah, this will do," the ghost said, point-
ing at a tin with, "Asin tibuok, powered",
on the label, "would you mind ever so

much to take this upon your person?"
The pretty lady held it lightly in her
hand, admiring the green patina, "you
can't take it yourself?" She asked.
"Well, you see..." The ghost started,
but suddenly they heard a rummaging
above them and a light emerged from the
top of the spiral staircase, "... We must
take our leave of this place".
"Hello..." The old merchant called out,
"Leeroy, is that you?" Though no soul an-
swered him.

So it was that the ghost took the pretty
lady past the East River and through
the secret entrance, found under Gladly
Bridge, into the catacombs. Under the
light of the little glowing star the tunnel
walls that encased them appeared almost
slimy.
"If you could be so kind as to sprinkle
the salt behind you as we walk, well as
you walk and I float," the ghost giggled, "I
would be much obliged".
The pretty lady twisted the cap off of
the tin and took a pinch of salt between
her pretty fingers and let the grains fall
onto the almost mossy ground which
hissed a little in response, "oh my!" She
said.
"Quite," the ghost said, "just like that,
that's the story."
#
After what felt like a while the ghost

muttered something and the little glowing
star dimmed.
"Curious, I think that I can hear some-
thing," the pretty lady said, being as it
were that she was in possession of the
most perfectly cute ears.
"Quiet," the ghost said, "we shan't
wake them just yet."
And the pretty lady and ghost entered
the Cavern of Drangarth within which lay
the sleeping souls of the Army of Nafoo.
#
Silently the ghost slunk, with the pretty
lady, to the opposite side of the snoring
throng. It was with an eternity of skill and
cunning by which the ghost conjured the
blinding orb that awoke the spooky crowd
and had them rush toward the salt-traced
tunnel. The screams of the salinated spir-
its as they fizzed into an effervescent
ether sent shivers down the pretty lady's
pretty spine. The Cavern of Drangarth

had become empty except for the pretty
lady, the ghost and the hovering little dim
star.
"There was so much I had wanted to
do," the ghost said, "but I had no body to
do it with. That is, until this evening..."
"My..." The pretty lady said.
"Thank you, you have given me peace."
The ghost said, fading away into nothing-
ness.
