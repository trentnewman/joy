Dear Julia,

Wishing you a joyful Christmas season!
Thank you for not only being an
outstanding supervisor but also for
opening your home to me during my visit to
Dunedin. I'm grateful for your generosity.

I hope this holiday season brings you and
the family moments of joy, laughter, and
relaxation. Looking forward to catching up
and sharing some festive cheer.

Warmest wishes,
Trent
